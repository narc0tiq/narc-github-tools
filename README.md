These are some Python tools I've written to interact with the Github API.

Currently, there's only the one:
* `query-release-data.py` will ask for and display data about the latest releases of one or more Github projects, by name (e.g., `narc0tiq/github-tools`).
* If I ever write more, they will be collated into this set.
